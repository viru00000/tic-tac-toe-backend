# Tic-Tac-Toe Backend API

This project provides the backend logic for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. It includes functionality for user registration and login, game creation, making moves, tracking game history, and restarting games. This is designed for a multiplayer experience, where one player (Player X) can start a game and invite an opponent (Player O) to play.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows users to create an account.
- **User Login**: Users can log in to play the game.
- **Start a Game**: A player can start a new game and invite an opponent.
- **Make a Move**: Players can make a move on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- **Game History**: Players can view the history of games theyâ€™ve played, including the timeline of moves.
- **Restart a Game**: Players can restart a game with the same opponent.

3. [Technologies Used](#technologies-used)
4. The frontend will be available on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Frontend Structure

- **index.ejs**: The main HTML file containing the structure for user authentication, game setup, game board, and history.
- **style.css**: CSS file to style the page, game board, buttons, and forms.
- **app.js**: JavaScript file handling the logic for:
    - User registration and login
    - Starting a game and making moves
    - Displaying the game board and updating moves
    - Fetching and displaying game history

### HTML Structure Overview

- **Authentication Section (`#auth`)**:
    - **Register Form (`#register`)**: Allows new users to sign up.
    - **Login Form (`#login`)**: For existing users to log in.
    - **Game Controls (`#gameControls`)**: Allows the logged-in user to invite an opponent to start a game.

- **Game Board (`#gameBoard`)**:
    - Displays the Tic-Tac-Toe grid (3x3).
    - Allows players to click on cells to make their move.

- **Game History (`#gameHistory`)**:
    - Displays the history of previous games, including opponent details and results.

## How to Use

1. **Register a User**:
    - Fill in the "Username" and "Password" fields in the registration form and submit.

2. **Login**:
    - After registration, you can log in by entering your credentials in the login form.

3. **Start a Game**:
    - After logging in, enter the opponent's username and click "Start Game".

4. **Gameplay**:
    - Click on the cells of the Tic-Tac-Toe board to make moves. The game alternates turns between 'X' and 'O'.

5. **View Game History**:
    - After the game ends, you can fetch the game history by clicking the "Fetch Game History" button.

6. **Restart Game**:
    - Click "Restart Game" to start a new match.

    ## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup language for the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling language for the layout and appearance of the web page and game board.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the interactive elements of the game, such as making moves and updating the board.
- **AJAX / Fetch API**: To make asynchronous requests to the backend (e.g., logging in, starting a game, making a move).
